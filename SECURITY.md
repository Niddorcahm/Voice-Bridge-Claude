## Security Considerations for Medical Use

Voice Bridge Pathology is designed for use in medical environments and handles potentially sensitive medical information. This document outlines security considerations and best practices.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: security@voice-bridge-medical.org
- **Encrypted Email**: Use our PGP key (available on request)
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Medical Data Security

### HIPAA Compliance

Voice Bridge Pathology is designed with HIPAA compliance considerations:

- **Data Minimization**: Only processes voice input and text transcriptions
- **Encryption**: Supports encryption of stored transcriptions
- **Access Controls**: File-based access control through OS permissions
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all activities
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies

### Azure Cognitive Services Security

When using Azure Speech Services:

- **Data Processing**: Voice data is processed by Microsoft Azure
- **Privacy Policy**: Subject to Microsoft's Privacy Statement
- **Compliance**: Azure Speech Services is HIPAA-compliant when properly configured
- **Data Residency**: Configure appropriate Azure regions for compliance
- **Encryption**: All communication with Azure uses TLS encryption

## Application Security

### Authentication and Authorization

- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file system permissions
- **Configuration Security**: Protect configuration files containing API keys
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **User Access**: Implement appropriate user access controls

### Data Protection

#### In Transit
- All communication with Azure Speech Services uses HTTPS/TLS
- Local network communication (Claude Desktop integration) is unencrypted
- Consider VPN or secure networks for medical environments

#### At Rest
- Transcription files can be encrypted using built-in encryption
- Configuration files should be protected with appropriate permissions
- Log files may contain sensitive information - protect accordingly

#### In Memory
- Voice data is processed in memory and not persistently stored
- Transcription data is held in memory during session
- Memory is cleared when application terminates

### Network Security

#### Outbound Connections
- Azure Speech Services (required): `*.cognitiveservices.azure.com`
- Optional: Update services and package repositories

#### Local System Integration
- Uses `wmctrl` and `xdotool` for Claude Desktop integration
- File system access for configuration and logs
- Microphone access for voice input

### Input Validation

- Configuration file parsing includes input validation
- Medical dictionary files are validated for format
- User input is sanitized before processing
- Voice commands are validated against allowed patterns

## Deployment Security

### System Requirements

#### Minimum Security Configuration
```bash
# Set restrictive permissions on installation directory
chmod 750 ~/voice-bridge-claude
chmod 600 ~/voice-bridge-claude/config/voice_bridge_config.ini

# Protect log files
chmod 700 ~/voice-bridge-claude/logs
```

#### Environment Variable Security
```bash
# Use secure storage for environment variables
export AZURE_SPEECH_KEY="$(cat /secure/path/azure_key.txt)"

# Or use system keyring/credential manager
```

### Docker Security (if using containerization)

```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 voicebridge
USER voicebridge

# Minimal attack surface
FROM python:3.10-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    required-packages-only

# Read-only filesystem where possible
VOLUME ["/data", "/config"]
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Security

- **Regular Updates**: Keep Python dependencies updated
- **Security Scanning**: Use `safety` to scan for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary packages

```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Automated dependency updates
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
```

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Use `bandit` for Python security analysis
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Testing**: Security-focused testing included in test suite

```bash
# Security scanning
pip install bandit
bandit -r voice_bridge_app.py

# Type checking helps prevent security issues
mypy voice_bridge_app.py
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Medical Institutions

1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Deploy on isolated medical networks
   - Use firewalls to restrict unnecessary network access
   - Consider VPN for remote access

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Enable comprehensive audit logging
   - Monitor for unusual activity patterns
   - Implement log retention policies

4. **Data Governance**
   - Classify medical data appropriately
   - Implement data loss prevention measures
   - Regular security assessments

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Regular security training
   - Use static analysis tools

2. **Testing**
   - Include security testing in CI/CD
   - Penetration testing for production deployments
   - Regular vulnerability assessments

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Secure default configurations
   - Configuration validation
   - Secrets management

## Incident Response

### Detection

- Monitor application logs for security events
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor file system changes to critical directories

### Response Process

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess scope of incident

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Determine root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Restore from clean backups if necessary
   - Verify system integrity

4. **Lessons Learned**
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring and detection
   - Security awareness training

## Compliance and Regulatory

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

- **Administrative Safeguards**: Access control, workforce training
- **Physical Safeguards**: Workstation security, device controls
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit controls, integrity, transmission security

### International Considerations

- **GDPR**: For European deployments
- **Local Regulations**: Comply with local medical data protection laws
- **Industry Standards**: Follow relevant healthcare security standards

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@voice-bridge-medical.org
- **Emergency Contact**: Available 24/7 for critical security issues
- **Bug Bounty**: Security researchers are welcome to report issues
