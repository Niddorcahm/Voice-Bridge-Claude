* Security vulnerabilities must be reported confidentially
* Medical device regulations may apply to certain contributions

### Collaboration with Healthcare Professionals
* Respect the expertise of medical professionals using this software
* Understand the clinical context and workflow implications
* Collaborate constructively on medical terminology and accuracy

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct has heightened importance in medical environments where
patient safety and privacy are concerned.

## Medical-Specific Enforcement
